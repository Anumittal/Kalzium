  /** @class Painter
    *
    * A simple Painter class for Avogadro. Currently it can draw spheres, cylinders,
    * multiple cylinders (as in multiple bonds) and text.
    *
    * Each GLWidget has a Painter which you can get by calling GLWidget::painter().
    *
    * The motivation for having a centralized Painter class is that it allows for global
    * quality control. Just call setGlobalQualitySetting() to adjust the quality setting.
    *
    * Another nice thing is that it handles level-of-detail computation, so that
    * you can just call drawSphere(center,radius) and the Painter automatically
    * determines the correct
    * detail level based on the radius of the sphere, on the distance to the camera, and on
    * the global quality setting.
    *
    * The multiple cylinders are drawn in such a way that the individual cylinders avoid
    * hiding each other, at least in the default viewpoint.
    *
    * The text is drawn with a black outlining so that it remains readable regardless of the
    * background color.
