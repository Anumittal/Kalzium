		<name>Spin</name>
		<desc>The spin is an intrinsic angular momentum associated with microscopic particles. It is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon without any analogy in classical mechanics. Whereas classical angular momentum arises from the rotation of an extended object, spin is not associated with any rotating internal masses, but is intrinsic to the particle itself.</desc>

		<name>Decay Mode</name>
		<desc>The decay mode describes a particular way a particle decays.
		For radioactive decay (the decay of nuclides) the decay modes are:
		-> alpha decay (emission of a Helium-4 nucleus).
		-> &#946;- decay (emission of an electron)
		-> &#946;+ decay (emission of a positron)
		-> electron capture
		-> proton emission
		-> spontaneous fission
		-> Typically one decay mode predominates for a particular nuclide. </desc>
