		<name>Heating Coil</name>
		<desc>Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.</desc>

		<name>Vortexer</name>
		<desc>A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM when a contact sensor is activated. This way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly as well. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.</desc>

	</tool>
	<tool picture="rotationsverdampfer.jpg">
		<name>Rotary Evaporator</name>
		<desc>A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water that is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. This way solutions can be concentrated or purified. Through an attached vacuum pump the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.</desc>

	<tool picture="rueckflusskuehler.jpg">
		<name>Reflux Condenser</name>
		<desc>A reflux condenser subjects fluid to a process where a gas produced by heating is collected on the reflux condenser, where it is cooled until it condenses and runs back into the original fluid. Usually it is put on a round bottom flask or several neck flasks.</desc>
	</tool>
	<tool picture="pileusball.jpg">
		<name>Pileusball</name>
		<desc>A pileusball is used to fill pipettes. It produces a negative pressure which makes the fluid go into the pipette. If one lets air back into the ball the fluid will run out of the pipette.</desc>

	<tool picture="trockenrohr.jpg">
		<name>Drying Tube</name>
		<desc>There are reactions which need to be kept free of water. To make this possible one uses a drying tube. In it there is a hygroscopic chemical which will absorb all water.</desc>
	</tool>
	<tool picture="rg-halter.jpg">
		<name>Test tube fastener</name>
		<desc>With a test tube fastener you can easily hold test tubes. If you use a fastener there is a safe distance between the hand and the test tube and the tube can be hot. In particular, it is used when you hold a test tube over an open flame.</desc>

	<tool picture="messzylinder.jpg">
		<name>Graduate</name>
		<desc>In a graduate you can fill amounts of liquids relatively precisely. Furthermore, a graduate serves to let particulate matter sink. Following this, you can separate particulates from the fluid by decanting.</desc>

	<tool picture="thermometer.jpg">
		<name>Thermometer</name>
		<desc>With a thermometer you can determine the temperature. In a laboratory special thermometers are used, which can also be used within acids or bases.</desc>

	<tool picture="ruehrfisch.jpg">
		<name>Magnetic stir bar</name>
		<desc>Magnetic stir bars are highly chemically inert, small magnetic bars. Most heaters have a built-in magnet which can rotate. Through this rotation the magnetic stir bars are spun and the solution the magnetic stir bar is in is homogenized.</desc>
	</tool>
	<tool picture="destillierbruecke.jpg">
		<name>Distillation bridge</name>
		<desc>To separate a mixture you can use distillation amongst others. The distillation bridge is thereby the way between the two pots. In the one pot there is the mixture to be separated. Through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed again and drips in a round flask. As a rule, the bridge is cooled by return flow. In addition, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature on the distillation bridge.</desc>

		<name>Syringe</name>
		<desc>A syringe consists of two parts: A glass tube and a punch. Both are normally made of glass. A gas floats into the glass tube. As the syringe is a closed system the punch has to give way. This can be used measuring the volume of an reaction.</desc>

		<name>Separation Beaker</name>
		<desc>At the four ends of this separation beaker you put four small caps. While distilling, you can turn the beaker by 60 degree after a certain temperate has been reached. This way, at the end of the distillation all four caps have a specific liquid in it, depending on the boiling points of the liquid distilled.</desc>

	<tool picture="thermometer2.jpg">
		<name>Contact Thermometer</name>
		<desc>A contact thermometer is different from a regular thermometer because of its sensor for the current temperature. Such a thermometer is connected with a heating coild. If the sensor notices that the aimed temperature has been reached the contact thermometer will make the heating coild stop heating. Therefore in an experiment it is possible to have a constant temperature.</desc>
