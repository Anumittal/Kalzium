		<content><![CDATA[The alkaline metalls form the second group in the table of elements. The have the elektronstructur s<sup>2</sup>. Because of that their oxidationnumber is always +2. The higher the atomic number (de:Ordnungszahl) the higher the reactivity and electropositivity (de:Elektropositiver Charakter).<br>Even though the second ionisationenergie is pretty high they do form Me<sup>2+</sup>-Ions which have the noble-gas configuration. They are stabilized through the (de:Gitterenergie) and hydration enthalpie (de:Hydratationsenthalpie).]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[The name chalcogen means <i>oreformer</i>. They diversity is much bigger in comparison to the halogenes (Kevin: halogens are pretty similar, O,S,Se,Te and Po differ quite a lot). While oxygen and sulfur are pur non-metals, selene and tellur are transition-metals. Polonium is a pure metal but also radioactive. <sup>209</sup>Po has a half-life period of 105 years.<br>
				Because of its relativly small atomic radius, oxigen has a high electronegativity and thus mostly has -I and -II-Oxidationstages. Only with flour it form the +I-Ion (FO).<br>
					Most metalloxids are ionic and not covalent. All chalcogens are able to form covalent bonds using two electrons. Doing this they reach the noblegas configuration.]]></content>

		<name>Halogenoide</name>
		<content><![CDATA[The name halogene comes from the greek work <i>halos</i> which means salt. The halogene often form salts. They are very similar amoung each other. They are strictly non-metals. They are very electronegative and are the most reactive elements in the periodic table. For example, Flour is the most electronegative and reative element of all so that it even reacts with hydrogen at -250 Degree Celsius.<br>
				Because only one electron is mission to have the noblegas-configuration they all form -1-Ions (the salt) which is a exothermic reaction.<br>
					Because they have only one free electron they can only form compounds with <i>one</i> covalent bond (Kevin: only for example NaCl, never NaCl2 or something like that. A covalent bond is the oposite of a ion-bond).<br>
						Astat, the fifth element of this group, is radioactive as are all of it known isotopes. The one with the longest half-life period only has a half-time period of only 8.3 hours.]]></content>

		<name>Group 18: Nobel Gases</name>
		<content><![CDATA[The Nobel Gases (also "Inert Gases") form the 18. group in the peridic table of the elements. They have the elektronconfiguration s<sup>2</sup>p<sup>6</sup> which means they have a full valenzshell. Because of this their chemical reactivity if very low. Their very high ionizationenergies demenstrate this.
			Most elements form ions with this electro-configuration (nobel-gas configuration). Because nobel gases have no unpaired electrons their elemental state is atomic (unlike eg. oxigen). They don't small, have no colours, are non toxic and not inflamable. The atoms don't share van-der-waals forces. Thus, their melting- and boilingpoints are very low. Both increase with the number of protons because this causes a bigger atom radius which make the atoms polarisable [[I made that word up ;-) It means: for a very short time the atoms have a charge]]. This polarization increases the van-der-waals forces.<br>
				Helium has the lowest boilingpoint of all known matter.<br>
					The nobel gases have a share of 0.035% in the air. Ne: 1.6<sup>3</sup>, He: 5<sup>-4</sup>, Kr:1<sup>-4</sup>, Xe: 9<sup>-6</sup>]]></content>
