TODO for 3.2:
- CalulationDlg():
  - we need more modes like the Nernst-Equiation

- http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Si/key.html  
  and there "Go adjacent..."
 
- Have more than one modus in the quiz: The user should be able
  to decide a level (easy - moderate - difficult). Furthermore
  the whole dialog will be redesigned

- Printing: The user should be able to print all the information
  in a table and/or in the infodlg.cpp-style
