TODO for Kalzium 1.5:

* Miscellaneous bugs:
  + Select "Periodic Table"->Look->"Show Blocks"
    Click on any element in the d block (yellow)
    Now you get a dialog with a green background.
    The same, but opposite happens for elements in the p block (green)
    The legend as well as the colors should be checked.

	CN: It was marked as done but I can still reproduce it. The background
	    of the overview-widget is not always coresponding to the
		current sheme

  + Fix the startsize of the infodialog                             ----
    - make the html fit into the window
	- make the dialog have a sane size if there is no picture of 
	  the element
  
  + Some melting and boiling points are wrong.  How to reproduce:	----
	1. Enter Learning mode, click on Temperature tab
	2. Set temperature to zero.  There are now a list of "Elements
           with melting point around this temperature" in the tab.
        3. Note that quite a few, e.g. Berkelium and Rutherfordium
           have melting point of O K shown.
   PT: Carsten, could you please check the datas?
   PT: Ingwa, perhaps I fixed it, could you check further?
   CN: Pino, you fixed it by defining the correct color for elements which
       don't have any information about the bp and mp, right?
  
  + Ctrl-Q should close the subwindows.					----
    - Plot window							--
    - Data window							--
   CN: Indeed! Good idea
   PT: isn't Ctrl-Q "joined" to the main window closing?
   CN: Obviously not ;) Otherwise it would work

* The main window:
  + There is no legend in Learning Mode.							DONE-CN
   PT: actually, there is, but only for the time mode; we need a
       legend for the SOM
   CN: I think all the legendstuff should be unified in one drawin-
       method in pse.cpp

* The glossary window:
  + If you hit <Return> in the search, you close the window.  It	----
    should display the item.
   CN: simple focus-bug. Easy to fix

================================================================
This list includes both ideas and misfeatures. Proper bugs have been 
moved up above.

2.  They should have WhatsThis help as well.				----
   CN: not sure if that is needed if (1) is implemented
   IW: No, you are probably right.
   PT: what about reducing the size for that tooltip, just like
       normal tooltips?
   CN: Well, you have up to 9 colors in a legend, this will lead to
       nine explanations. A short tooltip is only possible with
	   really short explanations like "In the family-view you see
	   different families of elements" without explaining what
	   the members are. OTOH this migth really belong into a handbook

3.  The data dialog should be non-modal (definitely)			DONE-IW
   CN: Ingwa will do this.

4.  In "learning mode", "Time" should perhaps be "Discovery year".	----
   CN: Not only that, there should be more data about the time, for
       example which chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5
       years or so)

8.  An idea: Is there a way to get a table of different data?		----
   CN: Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
       guess. SOmething like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
       think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

13. Not a bug, but an idea: Make the glossary also a tool for		----
    translation.

18. An idea: When you run the mouse over the element table, it shows	DONE-CN
    selected data about the elements in the status bar.
   PT: nice, but only a few datas can be displayed
   CN: "Carbon (6), Weight: 12.01 u" would be the most important
       and most used information. I really like that
   
19. Which brings us to: The settings should be above the table, not in	----
    the status bar.
   CN: I implemented that on June 4th. I like it, Ellen from
       OpenUsability likes it as well...

22. The plot should be repainted immediately if something changes on	----
    the left.  The "Plot" button should go.
   PT: and if the user wants to change more than one option at once
       and then replot? If so, we'll replot more than once.
   CN: Not only that. I would love to make more than one plot possible:
       Comparing Metals from the 3rd with the metals from the 4th 
	   periods for example. This would be impossible with this
	   proposal. (see item 26)

24. The legend should be outlined in some way. A slight background for	----
    example...
   CN: Indeed.
   IW: Did some work on this.  More needed.
   CN: Rounded rect perhaps? Or a gradient (dark to light gray for example)

25 Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified    ----
   userinterface (less looks, easier menustructure, less information
   in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled

26 Plotting: Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period    ----
   transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them and only 
   plot the selected group
	
27 Plotting: More than one group should be "plottable". This would enable the  ----
    user to compare two or more groups, eg. 4th with 5th group



Plans for the future:

+ Standalone release of Kalzium
	* Feature freeze by the end of June. No strict date but lets try
	  to not add new things in July.
	
	* After one week of testing and improving I would like to release
	  Kalzium (together with libkdeedu for the plotting) on the 8th 
	  of July (a friday).
	
	* The release will be what is in trunk
	
	* Releasecriteria:
	  - Try to fix all bugs on bugs.kde.org
	  - Try to add all icons. For this purpose I started a thread here:
	  http://kde-artists.org/main/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,48/expv,0/topic,60.0
	  - Try to make the release very usable:
	  http://www.openusability.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=397&forum_id=250
	  - Try to write the documentation
	  - *must be* Update edu.kde.org/kalzium with screenshots
	  - *must be* increase the version number
	
	* Releasemechanismn:
	  - Announcement on kdeedu@kde.org
	  - Announcement on apps.kde.org 
	  - Announcement on annoucement@kde.org
	  - I will blog about the release and it goals

+ KDE 3.5-release
	* Try to make use of the feedback we get of the standalone release

	* The 3.5-release will probably be pretty identical with the standalone-release

	* We should again check for bugs.kde.org

+ KDE4-release
	* Switch to KCanvas2 so that scaling the table is possible?

	* Port to Qt4. We use a lot QValueList<T> and paintEvents, so I expect some fun :)

	* Implement the things in this TODO-file
