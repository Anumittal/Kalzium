TODO for KDE 3.1:
- write documentation

- clean up the code and fix the remaining bugs
  with the GUI (esp. the shrinking)
  //shrinking fixed, 31 March 02

- speed up the startup (trapni?)

- ValueVisualisation():
  - I think we should add a QTabWidget() in 
    which we put perhaps 4 different views.
    This could be atomradius, ionradius,
    electronegativity, ionisationeneríe 
  - Perhaps we can use KSvg? At least
    the whole KDialog should be precious.
    What about colourgradients?

- CalulationDlg():
  - restyle the Dialog (KBackgammon-like)
  - KMol works fine but looks distasteful
  - MWG works not at all
  - we need more modes like the
    Nernst-Equiation

- rename button[] to element[]
  //done 1. April 02 (not kidding ;)

- change ElementKP: no need to use typedef. Lets
  make it a KPushButton

- fix the size of the KPushButton (far to wide)
  //fixed April 1st 02

TODO for post-KDE 3.1:
-
