                           Release plan
                           ============

Status: Under discussion


Overview
--------

Currently we plan for 3 releases:

 - A standalone release of Kalzium in July
 - The release for KDE 3.5
 - The release for KDE 4.0

The reason for the standalone release is that we want user feedback
for the KDE 3.5 release.

All details of the release plan are below the TODO items for the
respective release.

Dates

2005-06-30    Feature freeze.  All features in the TODO for
              version 1.5 should be done at the end of this day.

2005-07-08    End of bug testing and fixing period.

2005-07-11    Release of Kalzium 1.5


----------------------------------------------------------------
                       TODO for Kalzium 1.5


Bugs
----


* Miscellaneous bugs:
  + Fix the startsize of the infodialog					----
    - make the html fit into the window
	- make the dialog have a sane size if there is no picture of 
	  the element

  + Make use of the biological symbol.					----
    CN: I lost the "translation" though, will have to look after it.
	

  + In the SOM: If the html-code gets to long the slider is also ----
    resized. Because of this the date jumps. This make the SOM
	unusable. Solution: Fix the layout of the SOM

  + Black overviewwidget if you hover over the table because     DONE-CN
    currentColor() is not set.

  + I don't know how to name this, have a look at the comment     ----
    in kalzium.cpp, method void Kalzium::slotShowScheme(int i) in
    case PSE::GRADIENT:
	Why is the number "2" there? Is the comment right and we
	should read the gradient? If so: Why does it work?
  
  + Ctrl-Q should close the subwindows.					----
    - Plot window							--
    - Data window							--
    - Glossary window							--
   CN: Indeed! Good idea
   PT: isn't Ctrl-Q "joined" to the main window closing?
   CN: Obviously not ;) Otherwise it would work

* The main window:
  + Too long delay before the tooltip arrives				DONE-CN
    CN: I made it a 500ms delay, that is 0.25 of what
	    it used to be

* The glossary window:
  + If you hit <Return> in the search, you close the window. Â It	----
    should display the item.

* Plotting:
  + Atomic Radius is commented out in the code.  Why?			DONE-CN
    CN: The reason is no longer uptodate. I commented it out
	    because of the changes of the radii (I added atomic+vdW-
		radius and needed to change the datastructure)
  + The Y axis value inside the "Groups to compare" box is unnecessary.	DONE-IW
  + The default value for "Last Element" should be number of elements.	DONE-IW


Features
--------

* Data
  + Add the half-life period of radioactive elements.
    CN: See Promethium, element 61

  + Make use of the scientist=""-tag in the file

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period		----
    transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them 
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.			----
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups, 
	eg. 4th with 5th group


================================================================
                       Future versions

* Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
  guess. Something like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
  think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

* Make the glossary also into a dictionary

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)



================================================================
                  Details of the release plan


* Standalone release of Kalzium
  + After one week of testing and improving I would like to release
    Kalzium (together with libkdeedu for the plotting) on the 8th 
    of July (a friday).
   IW: I changed this to Monday 11th for two reasons:
     - We have the weekend to fix really urgent bugs, and to do the
       packaging without stress.
     - It's better to do the release when people don't only want to
       think about the upcoming weekend.  This way, the release can
       get more attention.
	
  + Releasecriteria, prio 1:
    - Fix all bugs on bugs.kde.org
    - Add all icons. For this purpose I started a thread here:
      http://kde-artists.org/main/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,48/expv,0/topic,60.0
    - *must be* Update edu.kde.org/kalzium with screenshots
    - *must be* increase the version number
  + Releasecriteria, prio 2:
    - Make the release very usable:
      http://www.openusability.org/forum/forum.php?thread_id=397&forum_id=250
    - Write the documentation
   These prio 2 issues will be prio 1 for KDE 3.5

  + Releasemechanism:
    - Announcement on http://dot.kde.org
    - Announcement on kdeedu@kde.org
    - Announcement on apps.kde.org 
    - Announcement on announcement@kde.org (is this the correct address?)
    - I will blog about the release and it goals

* KDE 3.5-release
   + Make use of the feedback we get of the standalone release
   + The 3.5-release will probably be pretty identical with the
     standalone-release, except for bug fixes and usability issues.


* KDE4-release

  + Port to Qt4. We use a lot QValueList<T> and paintEvents, so I
    expect some fun :)
  + Switch to KCanvas2 so that scaling the table is possible?
    IW: Scaling can be made possible without KCanvas2 as well.
  + Implement the things in this TODO-file
