TODO for Kalzium 1.5:
Priority 1:
	- A math dialog:
	  -- integrate EqChem http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=14542
	  -- Adding a calculator for molecular weights
	  	-- the one part of the calculator works, now I need a parser parsing
		   a structure the user entered (CO2 --> 1xC + 2xO --> 48 g/mol)

	- Finish the learning mode
	  -- Make the state-of-matter work
	  -- Make the timeline work
	    -- One idea is that one could display what happend in the
		   selected year. Perhaps what Nobelprizes where given,
		   things like "World war II ended" and so on.
	  -- Add more texts for the groups and periods

Priority 2:
	- Different EN-Values (there are at least 3 different EN-scales)
	- create another design of the PSE. As Kalzium is now using QPainter
	  a lot different designs can be easisly implemented.
	  -- This is my favorite:
	  http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTableDisplay/indexS.1.html#tabletop
	     This would need the pictures for all elements. Some are very obvious
		 (iron could be displayed as a nail for example, Silicon as a glas
		 or as a Computer-CPU), some are pretty hard. Some are connected with
		 famous people (Einsteinium: Alber Einstein, Fermium: Enrique Fermi).
		 For those elements we could use photos.

	     Like all macintosh-application it just looks good.
