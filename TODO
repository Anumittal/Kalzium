TODO for KDE 3.1:
- write documentation

- extend the quiz so that the users gets a feedback of which
  were the correct answers.
  //fixes: the dialog now appears, though the look is not perfect

- clean up the code and fix the remaining bugs
  with the GUI (esp. the shrinking)
  //shrinking fixed, 31 March 02

- speed up the startup (trapni?)

- CalulationDlg():
  - KMol works fine but looks distasteful
  - MWG works not at all // KDE 3.2
  - we need more modes like the Nernst-Equiation // KDE 3.2

- go through the code and check if all QWhatsThis:: really appear

- fix the size of the KPushButton (far to wide)
  //this is a Keramik-issue. Lets look how Keramik is 4 week before
  //KDE 3.1 and see if a fix is still needed

- show in a small map the surrounding elements
	//the map itself is now done. Still missing: a nice design

- slotrenaming

TODO for post-KDE 3.1:
- ValueVisualisation():
  - I think we should add a QTabWidget() in 
    which we put perhaps 4 different views.
    This could be atomradius, ionradius,
    electronegativity, ionisationeneríe 
  - Perhaps we can use KSvg? At least
    the whole KDialog should be precious.
    What about colourgradients?

- http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Si/key.html  
  and there "Go adjacent..."
  // KDE 3.2 though the code is already working
