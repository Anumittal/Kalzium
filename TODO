TODO for KDE 3.1:
- go through the code and check if all QWhatsThis:: really appear

- slotrenaming

TODO for post-KDE 3.1:
- CalulationDlg():
  - MWG works not at all // KDE 3.2
  - we need more modes like the Nernst-Equiation // KDE 3.2
  - new look (use .ui)

- ValueVisualisation():
  - I think we should add a QTabWidget() in 
    which we put perhaps 4 different views.
    This could be atomradius, ionradius,
    electronegativity, ionisationeneríe 
  - Perhaps we can use KSvg? At least
    the whole KDialog should be precious.
    What about colourgradients?

- http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Si/key.html  
  and there "Go adjacent..."
  // KDE 3.2 though the code is already working
 
- Have more than one modus in the quiz: The user should be able
  to decide a level (easy - moderate - difficult). Furthermore
  the whole dialog will be redesigned

- Printing: The user should be able to print all the information
  in a table and/or in the infodlg.cpp-style
