TODO for KDE 3.1:
- fix bugs if someone finds them

TODO for post-KDE 3.1:
- CalulationDlg():
  - we need more modes like the Nernst-Equiation

- ValueVisualisation():
  - I think we should add a QTabWidget() in 
    which we put perhaps 4 different views.
    This could be atomradius, ionradius,
    electronegativity, ionisationeneríe 
  - Perhaps we can use KSvg? At least
    the whole KDialog should be precious.
    What about colourgradients?

- http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Si/key.html  
  and there "Go adjacent..."
 
- Have more than one modus in the quiz: The user should be able
  to decide a level (easy - moderate - difficult). Furthermore
  the whole dialog will be redesigned

- Printing: The user should be able to print all the information
  in a table and/or in the infodlg.cpp-style
