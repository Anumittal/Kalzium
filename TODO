                       TODO for Kalzium 1.5


Bugs
----


* Miscellaneous bugs:
  + Fix the startsize of the infodialog					DONE-PT
    - make the dialog have a sane size if there is no picture of 
      the element							DONE-PT
    - make the html fit into the window					DONE-CN

  + Make use of the biological symbol.					----
    CN: I lost the "translation" though, will have to look after it.

  + In the SOM: If the html-code gets to long the slider is also	DONE-PT
    resized. Because of this the date jumps. This make the SOM
	unusable. Solution: Fix the layout of the SOM

  + Black overviewwidget if you hover over the table because		DONE-CN
    currentColor() is not set.

  + I don't know how to name this, have a look at the comment		 ----
    in kalzium.cpp, method void Kalzium::slotShowScheme(int i) in
    case PSE::GRADIENT:
    CN: Why is the number "2" there? Is the comment right and we
        should read the gradient? If so: Why does it work?

  + Ctrl-Q should close the subwindows.					----
    - Plot window							--
    - Data window							--
    - Glossary window							--
   CN: Indeed! Good idea
   PT: isn't Ctrl-Q "joined" to the main window closing?
   CN: Obviously not ;) Otherwise it would work

* The main window:
  + Too long delay before the tooltip arrives				DONE-CN
    CN: I made it a 500ms delay, that is 0.25 of what
        it used to be
    CN: After using it for some days I find the 500ms to
        short. The tooltip is constantly in my way. What
        do you say?

* The glossary window:
  + If you hit <Return> in the search, you close the window. Â It	----
    should display the item.

* Plotting:
  + Atomic Radius is commented out in the code.  Why?			DONE-CN
    CN: The reason is no longer uptodate. I commented it out
        because of the changes of the radii (I added atomic+vdW-
        radius and needed to change the datastructure)
  + The Y axis value inside the "Groups to compare" box is unnecessary.	DONE-IW
  + The default value for "Last Element" should be number of elements.	DONE-IW


Features
--------

* Data
  + Add the half-life period of radioactive elements.			DONE-CN
    CN: See Promethium, element 61

  + Make use of the scientist=""-tag in the file			DONE-CN

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period		----
    transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them 
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.			----
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups, 
    eg. 4th with 5th group


================================================================
                       Future versions

* Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
  guess. Something like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
  think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

* Make the glossary also into a dictionary

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)

* Make use of hotnewstuff. In the detailinfodlg there should be
  a weblookup. If the user click on a button Konq will start with
  a page about the element. Of course, the user should be able
  to decide which page.
  For this we could create a simple editor and store it in xml.
  on edu.kde.org we would enable KHNS so that users can share
  their pages. Imaginge for example the different wikipedia-languages

* Add the weblookup also in the glossary
