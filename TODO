TODO for Kalzium 1.5:


================================================================
Items from a brainstorming session with ingwa:


1:  The legend (s-Block, d-Block, etc) should have tooltips		DONE-CN
   
2.  They should have WhatsThis help as well.				----
   CN: not sure if that is needed if (1) is implemented
   
3.  The data dialog should be non-modal (definitely)			----
   CN: Ingwa will do this.
   
4.  in "learning mode", "Time" should perhaps be "Discovery year".	----
   CN: Not only that, there should be more data about the time, for
       example which chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5
       years or so)
	   
5.  Learning mode, Temperature: Still a number of elements with		----
    melting and boiling points = 0K
   CN: don't understand this point
   IW: How to reproduce:
	1. Enter Learning mode, click on Temperature tab
	2. Set temperature to zero.  There are now a list of "Elements
           with melting point around this temperature" in the tab.
        3. Note that quite a few, e.g. Berkelium and Rutherfordium
           have melting point of O K shown.
   
6.  There is no legend in the main window for the states (liquid,	----
    solid, gas, etc) when the user is in the state-of-matter mode.
   CN: This is indeed missing. Pretty easy to add
   
7. In "temperature" there is no way to set an exact temperature.  The	----
   ruler jumps 10 degrees at a time.
  CN: This is indeed missing. Pretty easy to add

8.  An idea: Is there a way to get a table of different data?		----
   CN: Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
       guess. SOmething like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
       think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

9.  About Plot Data: The button says "Plot data", but the window	DONE-IW
    caption says "visualize data"
   CN: Pino, will you fix that? and (10)?

10. The plot data window has wide buttons but a very narrow plot	----
    area. :-)

13. Not a bug, but an idea: Make the glossary also a tool for		----
    translation.

14. The search for words should be above the word list.			----

15. If you hit return in the search, you close the window.  It should	----
    display the item.
   CN: simple focus-bug. Easy to fix

16. In the data window, if you use the scroll mouse it goes to the	----
    next/previous element.  There should be buttons to do the same.
   CN: Indeed! Good idea

17. Ctrl-Q should close the subwindows.					----
      Plot window							----
      Data window							----
   CN: Indeed! Good idea

18. An idea: When you run the mouse over the element table, it shows	----
    selected data about the elements in the status bar.

19. Which brings us to: The settings should be above the table, not in	----
    the status bar.
   CN: I implemented that on June 4th. I like it, Ellen from
       OpenUsability likes it as well...

21. There is too little space between the left edge and the table in	----
    the main window.

22. The plot should be repainted immediately if something changes on	----
    the left.  The "Plot" button should go.

23. When I choose "Gradient: van der Walls (sic!) Radius" the text is	----
    cut both to the left and to the right.
   CN: Typo fixed							done
   CN: The numbers are now stripped after digit number 4. Is this	----
       fixed now?
   IW: The numbers were never stripped to the left/right, but at the
       lower edge.  That is not yet fixed.

24. The legend should be outlined in some way. A slight background for	----
    example...
   CN: Indeed.


================================================================
Older TODO items.  Should be merged with above.
 

Priority 1:
	- Reintegrate the isotope-label (DONE, cn)
	
	- A math dialog:
	  -- integrate EqChem http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=14542
	  -- Adding a calculator for molecular weights
	  	-- the one part of the calculator works, now I need a parser parsing
		   a structure the user entered (CO2 --> 1xC + 2xO --> 48 g/mol)

	- Finish the learning mode
	  -- Make the state-of-matter work (DONE, cn)
	  -- Make the timeline work        (DONE, cn)
	    -- One idea is that one could display what happend in the
		   selected year. Perhaps what Nobelprizes where given,
		   things like "World war II ended" and so on.
	  -- Add more texts for the groups and periods

	- Add gradientdrawing for properties like density and atomic weight like here:
	    http://www.synergycreations.com/periodic/screenshots/PT-crustal.gif
		(DONE, cn)

Priority 2:
	- Different EN-Values (there are at least 3 different EN-scales)
	- create another design of the PSE. As Kalzium is now using QPainter
	  a lot different designs can be easisly implemented.
	  -- This is my favorite:
	  http://www.theodoregray.com/PeriodicTableDisplay/indexS.1.html#tabletop
	     This would need the pictures for all elements. Some are very obvious
		 (iron could be displayed as a nail for example, Silicon as a glas
		 or as a Computer-CPU), some are pretty hard. Some are connected with
		 famous people (Einsteinium: Alber Einstein, Fermium: Enrique Fermi).
		 For those elements we could use photos.
	  -- Another one
	  http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/products/ichem/
	     Like all macintosh-application it just looks good.
	  --Another one
		 http://www.synergycreations.com/periodic/

	  -- Plotting Dialog
	     - Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period transitionmetals 
		   and so on. The user can easily select them and only plot the selected
		   group
		 - More than one group should be "plottable". This would enable the user 
		   to compare two or more groups, eg. 4th with 5th group

	  -- Datasets:
	  	 - Add ionradii for the different ions
		 - Add more ion.energies
		 - Add electroaffinities
		 - Add texts where an element is used
		 - Add the info where the name of an element comes from (eg Osmium means
		   "I smell" in latin

Priority 3:
	- Mendeljev-PSE
