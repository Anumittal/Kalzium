molecular calculator done.

%%% TODO (this week)

<major bugs>
1.) ADD TOOL-TIPS, WHATS THIS ... to all widgets.

2.) Fix Bug: I cannot find a way to change the value of the second combobox in
the "Amount of solute" and the "Density of solute" line... It is "grams"
and "liter" here, no matter which item I select. Can you reproduce that?
</major bugs>

1.) Add an icon in the "title page" taking help from kde-artists list

2.) Increase the fontsize

3.) fix Bug: When I start the "Perform Calculations" dialog the
"Introduction" page on the left is not selected.

4.) Alias: Add more aliases

5.) Make the equation balancer appear.

6.) fix Bug: Nuclear Calculator: The "NOTE"-text is wrong, there are no longer
any radiobuttons.

7.) fix Bug: Nuclear Calculator: Nothing happens when I switch from "Mass" to
"Moles" in the "Other data"-widget.

8.) fix Bug: Nuclear Calculator: fix slider related issues

9.) Nuclear Calculator: In "Elemental data" there is a label with the
text "TextLabel" ;-), remove that.

10.) General comment: The "Help text widget" on top of each calcualtor
is really important, but you have "NOTE:" there sometimes, and sometimes
not. I think the "NOTE:" is not needed.

11.) Add the calculator action into the menu

12.) "reset" (the button) has to be "Reset" (KDE GUI policy)

13.) The help-button doesn't do anything right now (as you know, just
for your TODO-list).

14.) Please add yourself to the "Thanks to" page in the about-dialog.

%%% later.
#1 > plasmoid widget for the molecular calculator.
#2 > Additional parsers ( history ) and prediction mode.
