			 TODO for Kalzium KDE4
			 =====================

* Making the table scalable. The basic code is already there and working. See
 - http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/blob/master/libavogadro/src/periodictableview.cpp
 - http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/blob/master/libavogadro/src/periodictableview.h
 That code needs to be finished (making it scalable) and then ported to Kalzium

* 3D-code: Please read the TODO on the Avogadro side. All ideas and 
  any progress is handled there: http://avogadro.sourceforge.net/wiki/To_Do

* Multiplechoicetests with autogenerated questions: 
	* "What element does the symbol Br represent?"
	* "What is the symbol for gold?"
	* "Which element (show two or more) has a greater mass?"
  These questions can be autogenerated because the answers are
  already in the database

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period		
    transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them 
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.			
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups, 
    eg. 4th with 5th group

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemistry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)

* Make use of hotnewstuff. In the detailinfodlg there should be
  a weblookup. If the user click on a button Konq will start with
  a page about the element. Of course, the user should be able
  to decide which page.
  For this we could create a simple editor and store it in xml.
  on edu.kde.org we would enable KHNS so that users can share
  their pages. Imaginge for example the different wikipedia-languages

* Add the weblookup also in the glossary

* Besides although for the "common user" is more easy to understand 
  the information in "... years", it's more correct and flexible in 
  scientific terms to use the scientific notation: ...x10e9 years.

* Add lesson-mode? The idea is that a teacher could create xml-files
  which can somehow be used as lessons. Perhaps something like
  "find out how many element boild at 200 Degree Celsius and above.
  With that information: Why is it so?"

* Add experiental mode: A teacher defines experiments (in xml) where
  fotos and texts are used to represent a experiment/task. Perhaps
  combined with openoffice-files (charts and so on). Like in CheExp.

* Thinking on people with some disabilities, it would be great if they can 
  select the elements on the grid by using cursor keys (or just tab key).

* Create a generic slider class. This slider-widget will be able to hide or
  show elements based on a value. For example (like today) the SOM, but also
  the atomic weight, the density or the electron-affinity. 
  This would help the user to get "a feeling" for the properties of the elements
  and would complement the gradient feature very well.

* There's no view of the natural occurrence of the elements. Look at 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_(standard) and see the notes 
  about borders.

* Printing: print properties selected by the user

* Spectrum-Classes
  + Create an editor. The user enters some wavelength and Kalzium will
    create a graphic from that data.

* Some websites with a lot of information:
