			 TODO for Kalzium KDE4
			 =====================

* 3D-Viewer
  - finish all the low-level rendering stuff (currently  
    doing text rendering), polish, and add a lot of comments.  
  - Crystal Viewer
	   -- For lattice
	   -- All Brevies cells
	   -- User defined distances (length of the vectors)
	   -- User defined angles (alpha, beta, gamma)
	   -- Show oktaedral and tetragonal void. For an oktaedral void:
		  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/6/61/Kfz_oktaederluecke.png
  - Molecule Viewer
	   -- Export as graphic (PNG, JPEG...)
	   -- Autorotation
		--- The user should be able to define which axes are 
			rotated and in which speed
		--- This could even be exported into a .gif-file or something
			as an animation
	   -- Highlighting of atoms in the GL-view
		--- [done] with a blue semitransparent thingy for single atoms
		--- [todo] highlighting of several atoms, for example to 
				   highlight a functional group like -OH or -COOH
	   -- If the user selects an atom in the GL-view highlight
		  that atom and also in the QTreeWidget
	   -- Calculations
		--- the distance between two atoms
		--- the angle and/or the torsion between three atoms
	   -- Drawing symbols into the position of an atom. 
		  For reference: http://smid.blueprint.org/images/107/pc442107.png
	   -- Drawing a plane through 3 atoms. Look
		  http://www.crystal.unito.it/tutojan2004/tutorials/I_surface/image006.gif
		  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_diffraction
	   -- Making the 3D-Viewer a standalone app or a KPart
		--- If the user clicks on a cml-file for example then the app opens and
			renders the content in 3D.
		--- Kalzium would just use this app/KPart
	   -- Zooming in and out

* Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
  guess. Something like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
  think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

* Multiplechoicetests with autogenerated questions: 
	* "What element does the symbol Br represent?"
	* "What is the symbol for gold?"
	* "Which element (show two or more) has a greater mass?"
  These questions can be autogenerated because the answers are
  already in the database

* Calculator: On "Remove": 'Grey out' the elements which are not
  in the molecule so that it is easier to spot the elements which
  can be removed.

* Log-scale of the gradient						

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period		
    transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them 
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.			
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups, 
    eg. 4th with 5th group

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)

* Make use of hotnewstuff. In the detailinfodlg there should be
  a weblookup. If the user click on a button Konq will start with
  a page about the element. Of course, the user should be able
  to decide which page.
  For this we could create a simple editor and store it in xml.
  on edu.kde.org we would enable KHNS so that users can share
  their pages. Imaginge for example the different wikipedia-languages

* Add the weblookup also in the glossary

* Besides although for the "common user" is more easy to understand 
  the information in "... years", it's more correct and flexible in 
  scientific terms to use the scientific notation: ...x10e9 years.

* Add lesson-mode? The idea is that a teacher could create xml-files
  which can somehow be used as lessons. Perhaps something like
  "find out how many element boild at 200 Degree Celsius and above.
  With that information: Why is it so?"

* Add experiental mode: A teacher defines experiments (in xml) where
  fotos and texts are used to represent a experiment/task. Perhaps
  combined with openoffice-files (charts and so on). Like in CheExp.

* Thinking on people with some disabilities, it would be great if they can 
  select the elements on the grid by using cursor keys (or just tab key).

* Create a generic slider class. This slider-widget will be able to hide or
  show elements based on a value. For example (like today) the SOM, but also
  the atomic weight, the density or the electron-affinity. 
  This would help the user to get "a feeling" for the properties of the elements
  and would complement the gradient feature very well.

* There's no view of the natural occurrence of the elements. Look at 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_(standard) and see the notes 
  about borders.

* Printing: print properties selected by the user

* Spectrum-Classes
  + Create an editor. The user enters some wavelength and Kalzium will
    create a graphic from that data.

* Some websites with a lot of information:
