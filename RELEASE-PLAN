                  Details of the release plan


* Standalone release of Kalzium
  + After one week of testing and improving I would like to release
    Kalzium (together with libkdeedu for the plotting and the glossary) 
	on the 30th of August (a tuesday). Two days later I leave to to
	aKademy in Malaga, Spain.
	
  + Release criteria, prio 1:
    - Fix all bugs on bugs.kde.org
    - *must be* Update edu.kde.org/kalzium with screenshots
    - *must be* increase the version number
  + Release criteria, prio 2:
    - Make the release very usable:
    - Write the documentation
   These prio 2 issues will be prio 1 for KDE 3.5

  + Release mechanism:
    - Announcement on kde-edu@kde.org
    - Announcement on kalzium@kde.org
    - Announcement on www.kde-apps.org
    - Announcement on kde-announce@kde.org
    - I will blog about the release and it goals

* KDE 4-release
  + Switch to KCanvas2 so that scaling the table is possible?
    IW: Scaling can be made possible without KCanvas2 as well.
	CN: I guess KCanvas2 is dead, long live Qt 4.2 with the new 
	    QCanvas-ueber-widget?
  + Implement the things in the TODO-file
